# Rick and Morty Pomodoro Timer.

## Description

After looking for frameworks to improve my productivity whilst coding, I came across the (Pomodoro Technique)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique].
After a trial period I knew it was helping me over come procrastination but I couldn't find any existing tools that I liked.

I love Rick and Morty and I wanted to use a Pomodoro timer to increase my productivity (so I made this￼￼). The timer is activated by clicking on the portal. When the timer expires it will set off a Wubba Dubba Dub Dub alert and increment the counter.

## Tech Stack

- HTML 5
- CSS
- FlexBox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Google web fonts

## What I Learned

I love building my own tools like this, it was a great opportunity to improve my vanilla javascript knowledge before moving onto javascript frameworks such as React and Vue. Javascript was used to perform the following functions:

- Dynamically update the weekday label in the title
- detect the OnClick event on the portal image.
- Start the timer
- Update and rotate the active image
- Update and reset the timer label
- Play the mp3 sound bites.
